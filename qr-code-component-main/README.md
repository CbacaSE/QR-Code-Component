## My process
  I began by setting up visual mock up site with Figma. Once all of the design was duplicated from design preview, I began making Elements that I found fitting for my HTML. After getting my HTML elements in order, I began my CSS with styles that were suggested in the Style-guide. I was able to make this web page responsive with just CSS and HTML elements.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties

### What I learned

This project was just to solidify my knowledge. To be able to reproduce this project with custom properties was satisfying to be able to take something learned and put it into practice.

### Continued development

I want to continue to develop my CSS skills to be able to find a process that works more smoothly for myself. I want to be able to incorporate new CSS Elements to my projects that will help broden my knowledge.
